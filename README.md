# CJS - C-style JavaScript

JS framework that takes inspiration from the purely procedural style of old C programming and tries to offer simple features which can be modularized at will.
Any custom logic may be injected into this system, styles, transitions, animations, net code, anything can be well integrated since CJS is just functions and structs (objects).

CJS includes a Ticker which may or may not be used to control and sync visual changes such as animations. It outputs HTML CSS and JS.

CJS is not a builder. It's just front-end code that runs when you open a webpage.
